- Fixed collision cookie handling to calc an RTO when
  its an INIT collision.
- Fixed RTO calc to maintain a seperate variable to track
  if a RTO calc as been done, this allows the RTO var to be
  doubled during initial timeouts.
- Reduces the amount of stack used by process control.
- Use a constant for the peer chunk overhead.
