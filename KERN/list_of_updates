-  More macros for OS compatabilty
-  PR-SCTP would ignore FWD-TSN's above a rwnd's worth
   of TSN's (1 byte msgs).. this left the peer hopelessly
   out of sync.. or an attacker. So now we abort the assoc.
-  New IFN hash, also rename hashes to match addr/ifn now
   that the vrf has multiple.
-  Do not enable SCTP_PCB_FLAGS_RECVDATAIOEVNT per default
   as defined in the Socket API ID.
-  Export MTU information via sysctl.
