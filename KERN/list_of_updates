- Found bug in min split point bundling which caused
  incorrect, non-bundlable fragmentation.
- Added min residual to better control split points for
  both how big a msg must be as well as how much needs
  to be left over.
- With our new algo in place, we need to implicitly
  set "end of msg" on the sp-> structure otherwise we
  end up with "hung" associations.
- Fix bug in sctp_input which can result in a crash.
- Do not strip off IP options anymore.
