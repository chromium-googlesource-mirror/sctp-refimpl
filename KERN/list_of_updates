- Modular congestion control, with RFC2581 being the default.
- CMT_PF states added (w/sysctl to turn the PF version on)
- sctp_input.c had a missing incr of cookie case when the
  auth was bad. This meant a free was called without an
  increment to refcnt, added increment like rest of code.
- There was a case, unlikely, when the scope of the destination
  changed (this is a TSNH case). In that case, it would not free
  the alloc'ed asoc (in sctp_input.c).
- When listed addresses found a colliding cookie/Init, then
  the collided upon tcb was not unlocked in sctp_pcb.c
- Add error checking on arguments of sctp_sendx(3) to prevent it from 
  referencing a NULL pointer.
- Fix an error return of sctp_sendx(3), it was returing 
  ENOMEM not -1.
- Get assoc id was changed to use the sanctified socket api
  method for getting a assoc id (PEER_ADDR_INFO instead of
  PEER_ADDR_PARAMS).
- Fix it so a peeled off socket will get a proper error return
  if it trys to send to a different address then it is connected to.
- Fix so that select_a_stream can avoid an endless loop that
  could hang a caller.
- time_entered (state set time) was not being set in all cases
  to the time we went established.
-------------------New items below here above this is re-patch 9------------
- added pre-checks to the bindx call.
- use proper tick gathering macro instead of ticks directly.
- Placed reasonable boundaries on sets that a user can do
  that are converted to ticks from ms.
- Fix CMT_PF to always check to be sure CMT is on.
- Fix ticks use of CMT_PF.
- put back code to allow asconfs to be queued while INITs are in flight
  and before the assoc is established.
- bug in ADD-IP for the subset bound socket case when the peer has only
  one address
- fix ASCONF implicit success/error handling case
