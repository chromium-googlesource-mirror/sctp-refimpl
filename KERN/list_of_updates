- Change the Time Wait of vtags value to match the cookie-life
- Select a tag gains ability to optionally save new tags
  off in the timewait system.
- When looking up associations do not give back a stcb that
  is in the about-to-be-freed state, and instead continue 
  looking for other candiates.
- New function to query to see if value is in time-wait.
- Timewait had a time comparison error that caused very
  few vtags to actually stay in time-wait.
- When setting tags in time-wait, we now use the time
  requested NOT a fixed constant value.
- sstat now gets the proper associd when we do the query.
- When we process an association, we expect the tag chosen
  (if we have one from a cookie) to be in time-wait. Before
  we would NOT allow the assoc up by checking if its good.
  In theory this should have caused almost all assoc not
  to come up except for the time-comparison bug above (this
  bug was hidden by the time comparison bug :-D).
- Don't save tags for nonce values in the time-wait cache
  since these are used only during cookie collisions and do
  not matter if they are unique or not.
