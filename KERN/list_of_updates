- send call has a reference to uio->uio_resid in
  the recent send code, but uio may be NULL on sendfile
  calls. Change to use sndlen variable.
- EMSGSIZE is not being returned in non-blocking mode
  and needs a small tweak to look if the msg would
  ever fit when returning EWOULDBLOCK.
- FWD-TSN has a bug in stream processing which could
  cause a panic. This is a follow on to the codenomicon
  fix.
- PDAPI level 1 and 2 do not work unless the reader
  gets his returned buffer full. Fix so we can break
  out when at level 1 or 2.
- Fix fast-handoff features to copy across properly on
  accepted sockets
- Fix sctp_peeloff() system call when no true system call
  exists to screen arguments for errors. In cases where a
  real system call exists the system call itself does this.
- Fix raddr leak in recent add-ip code change for bundled
  asconfs (even when non-bundled asconfs are received)
- Make sure ipi_addr lock is held when walking global addr
  list. Need to change this lock type to a rwlock().
- Add don't wake flag on both input and output when the
  socket is closing.
- When deleting an address verify the interface is correct
  before allowing the delete to process. This protects panda
  and unnumbered.
- Clean up old sysctl stuff and get rid of the old Open/Net
  BSD structures.
- Add a function to watch the ranges in the sysctl sets.
- When appending in the reassembly queue, validate that
  the assoc has not gone to about to be freed. If so
  (in the middle) abort out. Note this especially effects
  MAC I think due to the lock/unlock they do (or with
  LOCK testing in place).
- Netstat patch to get rid of warnings.
- Make sure that no data gets queued to inactive/unconfirmed 
  destinations. This especially effect CMT but also makes a
  impact on regular SCTP as well.
- During init collision when we detect seq number out
  of sync we need to treat it like Case C and discard
  the cookie (no invarient needed here).
- Atomic access to the random store.
- When we declare a vtag good, we need to shove it
  into the time wait hash to prevent further use. When
  the tag is put into the assoc hash, we need to remove it
  from the twait hash (where it will surely be). This prevents
  duplicate tag assignments.
- Move decr-ref count to better protect sysctl out of
  data.
- ltrace error corrections in sctp6_usrreq.c
- Add hook for interface up/down to be sent to us.
- Make sysctl() exported structures independent of processor
  architecture.
- Fix route and src addr cache clearing for delete address case.
- Make sure address marked SCTP_DEL_IP_ADDRESS is never selected
  as src addr.
- in icmp handling fixed so we actually look at the icmp codes
  to figure out what to do.
- Modified mobility code. 
  Reception of DELETE IP ADDRESS for a primary destination and 
  SET PRIMARY for a new primary destination is used for 
  retransmission trigger to the new primary destination.  
  Also, in this case, destination of chunks in send_queue are 
  changed to the new primary destination.  
- Fix so that we disallow sending by mbuf to ever have EEOR
  mode set upon it.
