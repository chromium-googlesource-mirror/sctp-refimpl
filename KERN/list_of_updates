- take out a needless panic under invariants for sctp_output.c
- Fix addrs's error checking of sctp_sendx(3) when addrcnt is less than
  SCTP_SMALL_IOVEC_SIZE
- re-add back inpcb_bind local address check bypass capability
- Fix it so sctp_opt_info is independant of assoc_id postion.
- Fix cookie life set to use MSEC_TO_TICKS() macro.
- asconf changes 
 o More comment changes/clarifications related to the old local address "not"
   list which is now an explicit restricted list.

 o Rename some functions for clarity:
   - sctp_add/del_local_addr_assoc to xxx_local_addr_restricted() 
   - asconf related iterator functions to sctp_asconf_iterator_xxx()

 o Fix bug when the same address is deleted and added (and removed from the
   asconf queue) where the ifa is "freed" twice refcount wise, possibly
   freeing it completely.

 o Fix bug in output where the first ASCONF would not go out after the last
   address is changed (e.g. only goes out when retransmitted).

 o Fix bug where multiple ASCONFs can be bundled in the same packet with the
   and with the same serial numbers.

 o Fix asconf stcb iterator to not send ASCONF until after all work queue
   entries have been processed.

 o Change behavior so that when the last address is deleted (auto asconf on
   a bound all endpoint) no action is taken until an address is added; at
   that time, an ASCONF add+delete is sent (if the assoc is still up).

 o Fix local address counting so that address scoping is taken into account.

 o #ifdef SCTP_TIMER_BASED_ASCONF the old timer triggered sending of ASCONF
  (after an RTO).  The default now is to send ASCONF immediately (except for
  the case of changing/deleting the last usable address).
