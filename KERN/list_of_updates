- change number assignments for SHA225-512
- In cookie processing 1-2-1, we did not increment the stcb refcnt before
  releasing the tcb lock. We need to do this to keep the tcb from being
  freed by a abort or ?? unlikely but worth doing.
- extra receive info included the rcvinfo which killed the
  padding/alignment. We now redefine all the fields properly
  so they both align properly.
- Get rid of the sole net giant lock now that 7 does not need it.
- A peeled off socket would not close without an error due to
  its misguided idea that sctp_disconnect() was not supported
  on it. This fixes it so it goes through the proper path.
