- remove dead (duplicate) code from sctp_asconf.c
- remove duplicate #include <sys/priv.h> that is not under #ifdef FreeBSD
  version to allow compile on 6.1
- static analysis changes per the cisco SA tool including:
   o some SA_IGNORE comments
   o some checks for NULL before unlock.
   o type corrections int -> size_t
- Fix it so alloc_asoc takes a thread/proc argument. Without this
  we pass a NULL in to bind on implicit assoc setup and crash :-(
**************************************above is patch 11 **********
- take out a needless panic under invariants for sctp_output.c
- Fix addrs's error checking of sctp_sendx(3) when addrcnt is less than
  SCTP_SMALL_IOVEC_SIZE
- re-add back inpcb_bind local address check bypass capability

*** asconf changes ***
More comment changes/clarifications related to the old local address "not"
list which is now an explicit restricted list.

Rename some functions for clarity:
- sctp_add/del_local_addr_assoc to xxx_local_addr_restricted() 
- asconf related iterator functions to sctp_asconf_iterator_xxx()

Fix bug when the same address is deleted and added (and removed from the
asconf queue) where the ifa is "freed" twice refcount wise, possibly
freeing it completely.

Fix bug in output where the first ASCONF would not go out after the last
address is changed (e.g. only goes out when retransmitted).

Fix bug where multiple ASCONFs can be bundled in the same packet with the
and with the same serial numbers.

Fix asconf stcb iterator to not send ASCONF until after all work queue
entries have been processed.

Change behavior so that when the last address is deleted (auto asconf on
a bound all endpoint) no action is taken until an address is added; at
that time, an ASCONF add+delete is sent (if the assoc is still up).

Fix local address counting so that address scoping is taken into account.

#ifdef SCTP_TIMER_BASED_ASCONF the old timer triggered sending of ASCONF
(after an RTO).  The default now is to send ASCONF immediately (except for
the case of changing/deleting the last usable address).
