-  Somehow the disable fragment option got lost. We could
   set/clear it but would not do it. Now we will.
-  Moved to latest socket api for extended sndrcv info struct.
-  Moved to support all new levels of fragment interleave.
-  Codenomicon security test updates.
-  Robert Watson changes (with ifdefs)
-  Bug in stream reset (2 actually).
-  setpeerprimary could unlock a null pointer, fixed.
