- added pre-checks to the bindx call.
- use proper tick gathering macro instead of ticks directly.
- Placed reasonable boundaries on sets that a user can do
  that are converted to ticks from ms.
- Fix CMT_PF to always check to be sure CMT is on.
- Fix ticks use of CMT_PF.
- put back code to allow asconfs to be queued while INITs are in flight
  and before the assoc is established.
- During window probes, an ack'd packet might be left with the window
  probe mark on it causing it to be retransmitted. Change so that
  the flight decrease macro clears the window_probe mark.
- Additional logging flight size/reading and ASOC LOG. This
  is only enabled if you manually insert things into opt_sctp.h
  since its a set of debug code only.
- Found an interesting SMP race in the way data was appended which
  could cause a reader to lose a part of a message, had to
  reorder when we marked the message was complete to after
  the data was appended.
- bug in ADD-IP for the subset bound socket case when the peer has only
  one address
- fix ASCONF implicit success/error handling case
- proper support of jails in Freebsd 6>
- copy out the timeval for the 64 bit sparc world on cookie-echo 
  alignment error crashes without this).
