- Found bug in min split point bundling which caused
  incorrect, non-bundlable fragmentation.
- Added min residual to better control split points for
  both how big a msg must be as well as how much needs
  to be left over.
- With our new algo in place, we need to implicitly
  set "end of msg" on the sp-> structure otherwise we
  end up with "hung" associations.
- Room reserved up front in IP header by pushing IP
  header to back of mbuf.
- Fix so FR's peg count of retransmissions needed.
- Fix so an unlucky chunk that never gets across 
  will kill the assoc via the kill timer and send an
  abort too.
- Fix bug in sctp_input which can result in a crash.
- Do not strip off IP options anymore.
- Clean up sctp_calculate_rto().
- Get rid of unused sysctl.
- Fixed so we discard all M-Cast
- Fixed so port check done AFTER checksum
- Fixed bug in fragmentation code that prevented
  us from fragmenting a small complete message when
  we needed to.
- Tighten AUTH protocol error checks during INIT/INIT-ACK exchange
- Improve the handling of window probes, which were
  dropped by the receiver.
