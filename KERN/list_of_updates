- fixed autclose to not allow setting on 1-2-1 model.
- bounded cookie-life to 1 second minimum in socket option set.
- Delayed_ack_time becomes delayed_ack per new socket api document.
- Improve port number selection, we now use low/high bounds and
  no chance of a endless loop. Only one call to random per bind
  as well.
- fixes so set_peer_primary pre-screens addresses to be 
  valid to this host.
- maxseg did not allow setting on an assoc basis. We needed
  to thus track and use an association value instead of a inp value.
- Fixed ep get of HB status to report back properly.
- use settings flag to tell if assoc level hb is on off not
  the timer.. since the timer may still run if unconf address
  are present.
- check for crazy ENABLE/DISABLE conditions.
- set and get of pmtud (fixed path mtu) not always taking into account ovh.
- Getting PMTU info on stcb only needs to return PMTUD_ENABLED if
  any net is doing PMTU discovery.
- Panic or warning fixed to not do so when a valid ip frag is
  taking place.
- sndrcvinfo appearing in both inp and stcb was full size, instead
  of the non-pad version. This saves about 92 bytes from each struct
  by carefully converting to use the smaller version.
- one-2-one model get(maxseg) would always get ep value, never the
  tcb's value.
- The delayed ack time could be under a tick, this fixes so
  it bounds it to at least 1 tick for platforms whos tick
  is more than a ms.
- Fragment interleave level set to wrong default value.
- Fragment interleave could not set level 0.
- Defered stream reset was broken due to a guard check and ntohl issue.
- Found two lock order reversals and fixed.
- Tighten up address checking, if the user gives an address the sa_len
  had better be set properly.
- Get asoc by assoc-id would return a locked tcb when it was asked
  not to if the tcb was in the restart hash.
- sysctl to dig down and get more association details
-----------------Above here is the May 21 patch--------------------
- Fixes so we won't try to start a timer when we
  hold a wq lock for the iterator. Panda uses a
  silly recursive lock they hold through the timer.
