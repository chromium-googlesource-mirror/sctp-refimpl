- fixed autclose to not allow setting on 1-2-1 model.
- bounded cookie-life to 1 second minimum in socket option set.
- Delayed_ack_time becomes delayed_ack per new socket api document.
- Improve port number selection, we now use low/high bounds and
  no chance of a endless loop. Only one call to random per bind
  as well.
- fixes so set_peer_primary pre-screens addresses to be 
  valid to this host.
