- fix sctp_ifn initial refcount issue (prevents deletion)
- fix a bug during cookie collision that prevented an
  association from coming up.
- Fix it so the shutdown-pending flag gets removed (this is
  more for correctness then needed) when we enter shutdown-sent
  or shutdown-ack-sent states.
- Fix a bug that caused the receiver to sometimes NOT send
  a SACK when a duplicate TSN arrived. Without this fix
  it was possible for the association to fall down if the
  peer had no more data to send.
