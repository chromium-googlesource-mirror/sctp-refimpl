- sctp_input.c had a missing incr of cookie case when
  auth was bad. This meant a free was called without an
  increment to refcnt, added increment like rest of code.
- There was a case, unlikely, when the scope of the destination
  changed (this is a TSNH case). In that case, it would not free
  the alloc'ed asoc (in sctp_input.c).
- When listed addresses found a colliding cookie/Init, then
  the collided upon tcb was not unlocked in sctp_pcb.c
