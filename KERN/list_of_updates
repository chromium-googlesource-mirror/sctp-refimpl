- Fixes so we won't try to start a timer when we
  hold a wq lock for the iterator. Panda uses a
  silly recursive lock they hold through the timer.
- Add poor mans e-real (packet_logging) option.
- Allocate and start using SCTP_M_XXX for all SCTP_MALLOC() calls.
- sysctl now will get back the refcnt for viewing by onlookers.
