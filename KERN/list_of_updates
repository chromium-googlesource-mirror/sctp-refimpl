- fixed autclose to not allow setting on 1-2-1 model.
- bounded cookie-life to 1 second minimum in socket option set.
- Delayed_ack_time becomes delayed_ack per new socket api document.
- Improve port number selection, we now use low/high bounds and
  no chance of a endless loop. Only one call to random per bind
  as well.
- fixes so set_peer_primary pre-screens addresses to be 
  valid to this host.
- maxseg did not allow setting on an assoc basis. We needed
  to thus track and use an association value instead of a inp value.
- Fixed ep get of HB status to report back properly.
- use settings flag to tell if assoc level hb is on off not
  the timer.. since the timer may still run if unconf address
  are present.
- check for crazy ENABLE/DISABLE conditions.
- set and get of pmtud (fixed path mtu) not always taking into account ovh.
- Getting PMTU info on stcb only needs to return PMTUD_ENABLED if
  any net is doing PMTU discovery.
