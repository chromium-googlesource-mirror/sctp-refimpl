- Modular congestion control, with RFC2581 being the default.
- sctp_input.c had a missing incr of cookie case when the
  auth was bad. This meant a free was called without an
  increment to refcnt, added increment like rest of code.
- There was a case, unlikely, when the scope of the destination
  changed (this is a TSNH case). In that case, it would not free
  the alloc'ed asoc (in sctp_input.c).
- When listed addresses found a colliding cookie/Init, then
  the collided upon tcb was not unlocked in sctp_pcb.c
- Add error checking on arguments of sctp_sendx(3) to prevent it from 
  referencing a NULL pointer.
- Fix an error return of sctp_sendx(3), it was returing 
  ENOMEM not -1.
- Fix it so a peeled off socket will get a proper error return
  if it trys to send to a different address then it is connected to.
- Fix so that select_a_stream can avoid an endless loop that
  could hang a caller.
