- Add more comments to sctps_stats struture in sctp_uio.h
- Fix bug that prevented EEOR mode from working
  and simplified the can_we_split code in the process.
- Reduce lock contention for the tcb_send_lock. I did
  this especially for EEOR mode, still need to look at
  why I need a lock when removing from the tailq and the
  ->next is NOT null. A lock fixes it but it implies a
  bug yet exists.
- Activated Andre's proposed changes to better use the mbuf
  infrastructure.
- Fixed places that were not using the aloc macro's to take
  advantage of the per assoc cache.
