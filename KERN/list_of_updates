- fix source address selection when picking an acceptable address
- _prefered -> preferred
- CMT fast recover code added.
- Comment fixes in CMT.
- We were not giving a reason of cant_start_asoc per socket api
  if we failed to get init/or/cookie to bring up an assoc. Change
  so we don't just give a generic "comm lost" but look at actual
  states of dying assoc.
- change "crc32" arguments to "crc32c" to silence strict/noisy
  compiler warnings when crc32() is also declared
- A few minor tweaks to get the portable stuff truely portable
  for sctp6_usrreq.c :-D
- one-2-one style vrf match problem.
- window recovery had would leave chks marked for retran
  during window probes on the sent queue. This would then
  cause an out-of-order problem and assure that the flight
  size "problem" would occur.
- Solves a flight size logging issue that caused rwnd
  overruns, flight size off as well as false retransmissions.g
- Macroize the up and down of flight size.
- Fix a ECNE bug in its counting.
- The strict_sacks options was causing aborts when window probing
  was active, fix to make strict sacks a bit smarter about what
  the next unsent TSN is.
- Fixes a one-2-one wakeup bug found by Martin Kulas.
