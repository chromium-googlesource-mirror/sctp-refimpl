-  More macros for OS compatabilty
-  PR-SCTP would ignore FWD-TSN's above a rwnd's worth
   of TSN's (1 byte msgs).. this left the peer hopelessly
   out of sync.. or an attacker. So now we abort the assoc.
-  New IFN hash, also rename hashes to match addr/ifn now
   that the vrf has multiple.
-  Do not enable SCTP_PCB_FLAGS_RECVDATAIOEVNT per default
   as defined in the Socket API ID.
-  Export MTU information via sysctl.
-  Vrf's need table id's. This is default for
   BSD, but may be other things later when BSD
   fully supports VRFs. 
-  Additional stream reset bug (caught by cisco dev-test).
-  Additional validations for the address in sending a message (socket api).
--------
-  Fix association notifications not to give the active open
   side false notifications.
-  Fix so sendfile and SENDALL will work properly (missing 
   flag to say socket sender is done).
-  Fix Bug that prevented COOKIES from being retransmitted.
-  Break out connectx into helper sub-models so that iox routines can
   reuse the helpers.
** its compiling on XR now :-D
