Updates waiting for Michales finish:
**********************************
- send call has a reference to uio->uioresid in
  the recent send code, but uio may be NULL on send
  file calls. Need to change to use sndlen.
- Need to do this for all calls above the copy loops.
  (change to sndlen all uio->xxx)
- EMSGSIZE is not being returned in non-blocking mode
  and needs a small tweak to look if the msg would
  ever fit when returning EWOULDBLOCK.
- FWD-TSN has a bug in stream processing which could
  cause a panic. This is a follow on to the codenomicon
  fix.
- PDAPI level 1 and 2 do not work unless the reader
  gets his returned buffer full.
- Honda-san has a patch in queue to.
*************************************
For all but Honda-san's patch I am maintaining
a patch.txt file on my local machine. For Panda 
we are applying the patches in the Panda side
only.
