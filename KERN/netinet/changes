1) More NKE changes for apple.
2) More sysctl's added to control variables
   without requiring user intervention through socket
   api.
3) Re-wrote ipv6 source address selection. It now
   trys to find matching scope first. Also special
   handling of sending to a link local that is on
   the local machine.. strange things can happen
   i.e. the route goes through the loop back interface 
   and yet the packet arrives (from receivers side) on
   the actual interface. Also we can't send to a ll
   that is us with a source of ::1. Special handling
   for the c-sum was needed and so now we check to
   see if the src/dest are the same to find out
   if the csum is disabled
4) Changes to make the assoc-id be equal to the local
   vtag. This will make it so that we have less likelyhood
   of association reuse issue for sloppy api coders... since
   vtags already go into a vtag hash for time-wait. Note also
   we no longer have selected ways of building vtag hash.. just
   a system wide hash.
