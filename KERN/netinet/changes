Patch 24 change log

1) Fix for sctp_sendmsg. If the sa_len was set to 0 all worked as
   it should... however if sa_len is set to a proper value then
   garbage would be set as the address size.
2) debug in timer routine made to print under debug
   level 1 instead of whenever debug is defined
3) port 0 check moved before the checksum verification.
4) Added missing port 0 check for IPv6
